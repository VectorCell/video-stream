video-stream
============

A simple php page to facilitate streaming video from a server.

This page relies on video files being located all in the same directory (or nested in subdirectories of that directory).

The videos should be HTML5-compatible mp4s. An explanation for getting mp4s to play in Firefox on Linux is provided for Linux users when they view the page.

This page has been tested on a Linux server, but might possibly work with other UNIX-like operating systems. To work in Windows some modifications would need to be made.
